title: "Assignment 4 - Data Wrangging with `dplyr`"
---

***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment4.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- Notice that if there is `eval=FALSE` in the first line of the code chunk, the chunk will not be execute.

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas under Assignment 4. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

-------

#### 1. Install `tidyverse` package

An R package can be installed by `install.packages` function. Install `tidyverse` if you have not done so. 

```{r}
#install.packages('tidyverse')
```

-------

#### 2. Read the data using `read_csv`

Use `read_csv` function to import the US Covid 19 data at [link](https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv).  Don't forget to import `tidyverse` (library(tidyverse)) so that you can use read_csv. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
df = read_csv('https://covidtracking.com/data/download/all-states-history.csv')
```

-------

#### 3.  Fix the date and ceate some new variables

`lubridate` is a package of the `tidyverse` packages.  We will make uses of `lubridate` in this question.

- Use the below codes to create `month`, `weekday` and `monthday` variables

```{r}
library(lubridate)
df$month = month(df$date)

# day of the week
df$weekday = wday(df$date)

# day of the month
df$monthday <- mday(df$date)
```

-------

#### 4. Create new variables with `case_when`. 

The function `case_when` is a good option to create a new variable from existing variable.  For example, this below codes create a new variable, `daily_death`, from `deathIncrease` variable.  `deathIncrease` is the number of daily new death by Covid19.  The new variable `daily_death` takes three values:  low (if `deathIncrease` less than 3), medium (`deathIncrease` from 3 to 14), and high (`deathIncrease` more than 14).  Please notice that this can also be done in a different way as shown in Assignment 3. 

```{r}
df$daily_death <- case_when(
  df$deathIncrease <3 ~ 'low',
  df$deathIncrease <=14 ~ 'medium',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)
```

- Create variable `month2` that takes three values: early_month (day of the month from 1-10), mid_month (day of the month from 11-20), and end_month (day of the month > 20).

```{r}
df$month2 = case_when(df$date<="2021-02-10" ~ 'early_month', df$date>="2021-02-11" & df$date <='2021-02-20' ~ 'mid_month', df$date > '2021-02-20' ~ 'end_month')
```

- Create variable `weekend` that takes two values:  1 if it's Saturday or Sunday or 0 otherwise. 

```{r}
df$weekday = weekdays(df$date)
df$weekend = if_else((df$weekday=='Saturday') | (df$weekday=='Sunday'),1,0 )
```

-------

#### 5. Select function

Use the select function to deselect the column `totalTestsViral` from the data.

```{r}
df %>% select(-totalTestsViral)
```

-------

#### 6. Pipe Operator ( %>% )

Pipe operator offers another way to write R codes. Many times, it makes the codes more readable.  Pipe works very well with all the `tidyverse` packages. Refer to [these slides](../slides/4_dplyr.html#15) (slide 15, 16, 17 and 18) to rewrite the below codes using pipe operator

```{r}
x <- c(1:10)

# square root of x
# Conventional way: sqrt(x)
#Pipe
x %>% sqrt

# Conventional way: sum(sqrt(x))
#Pipe
x %>% sqrt %>% sum

#conventional way:log(sum(sqrt(x)))
#Pipe:
x %>% sqrt %>% sum %>% log

# log base 2 of 16
#conventional way: log(16, 2)
#Pipe:
16 %>% log(2)

```

-------

#### 7. Combo 1: group_by + summarise

This combo is used when you want to apply a function/calculation to different groups of the data. For example, to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `weekday`, we use:

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(weekday) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month`

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `month2`

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(month2) %>% 
  summarise(mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) by `weekend`

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(weekend) %>% 
  summarise(median(positiveIncrease))
```


-------

#### 8. Combo 2: filter + group_by + summarise

An example: to calculate the average number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) in January and February separately, we use:

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(month==1|month==2) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(positve_increase = mean(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the median number of cases (`positiveIncrease`) on the weekend by `month` in October and November 2020. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(month==10|month==11) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(positve_increase = median(positiveIncrease))
```

- Calculate the average number of death at different periods of a month (`month2` variable) in Fall 2020

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(month2) %>% 
  summarise(death_calc = mean(death, na.rm=TRUE))
```

- Compare the average number of hospitalizations between weekdays and weekends in Summer 2020

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(month==6|month==7|month==8) %>% 
  group_by(weekend) %>% 
  summarise(mean_hosp = mean(df$hospitalized, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- Redo Questions 14 and 15 in [Assignment 3](assignment3.html) using the combos.  Notice:  you also need to use the data used in Assignment 3.  

Find the median cases by weekdays in Rhode Island in 2021

```{r}
df2 = read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-states.csv')
```

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
df2$weekdays = weekdays(df2$date)
df2 %>% 
  filter(state == 'Rhode Island', date > '2021-01-01') %>% 
  group_by(weekdays) %>% 
  summarise(median_cases = median(cases, na.rm=TRUE))
```


Compare the median cases in Rhode Island in June, July, August and September in 2021.

```{r}
df2$month = months(df2$date)
df2 %>% 
  filter(state == 'Rhode Island', month=='June'|month=='July'|month=='August'|month=='September') %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(median_cases2 = median(cases, na.rm=TRUE))
```

#### 9. Combo 3: filter + group_by + summarise + arrange

Use the arrange function to find a month that has the highest number of deaths on the weekend. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(weekend==1) %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  summarise(n=mean(death, na.rm=TRUE)) 
```

-------

#### 10. Use your own dataset and implement the follows functions or combos. You can use the [Adult Census Income](../data/adult_census.csv) or [Titanic data](../data/titanic.csv). 

- select
- filter
- mutate
- summarise
- arrange
- count
- count + arrange
- filter + count + arrange
- group_by + summarise
- filter + group_by + summarise
- filter + group_by + summarise + arrange

```{r}
dft = read_csv('https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/data/titanic.csv')
```
```{r}
dft %>% select(PassengerId, Fare, Pclass, Age) %>% filter(Age > 15) %>% mutate(mean_age = mean(Age))
```
```{r}
dft %>% 
  group_by(Sex) %>% 
  count(Survived) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Survived))
```
```{r}
dft %>% filter(Survived==1) %>% group_by(Pclass) %>% summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare))
```
```{r}
dft %>% filter(Survived==1) %>% group_by(Pclass) %>% summarise(mean_fare = mean(Fare)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_fare))
```
