**Submission Guideline:**  Create one html file from Rmarkdown that answer all the following questions. Include the link of the html file to your Github webpage and submit the link to the html file to Canvas. 

-------

### Question 1. 

- Install the flexdashboard package using `install.packages("flexdashboard")`. 


- Create an empty dashboard. In Rstudio, File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Flex Dashboard. Knit the rmarkdown file and add the html link to this report. 

[Flex Dashboard](flex_db.html)

### Question 2. 

Use this template flex dashboard ([dashboard](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/flex_template.html), [Rmd](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/flex_template.Rmd))  to create a flex dashboard that

- Has a side bar

- Has at least three main Tabs

- Has at least four plots

- Shows a table data that can be searched

Done

### Question 3. 

We want users to be able to interact with our dashboard.  This can be done using `shiny`. A flex dashboard using `shiny` requires a domain to host it.  We will use shinyapps.io, which can host five dashboard for free. If we want to host more than five dashboards, we can create multiple accounts at shinyapps.io. 


Follow these below steps to create a shiny flex dashboard then publish it. 

- Install the following packages `shiny`, `packrat`, `rsconnect`. 

- Go to https://www.shinyapps.io/ and create an account 

- Go to https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard.  Account -> Tokens -> Show -> Show secret-> Copy the secret code. 

It should look like this


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='mbetancespichardo',
			  token='C1AFFB78FA1E503B0FFCBC9BA99AD78C',
			  secret='BYH75sfLEXqlBg8tI2j2nfUvHIEJWDUnLbIgCaWT')
```

- Paste the secret code into Rstudio Console and Run it. 

- Download a sample shiny flex dashboard: [Dashboard](https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/1_flex_select/), [Rmd](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/1_flex_select.Rmd)

- Click `Run Document` (Or Ctrl + Shift + K) to check the dashboard

- On right, top corner click Publish to Publish the dashboard to your acccount on shinyapps.io

- Your published dashboard should look like this
