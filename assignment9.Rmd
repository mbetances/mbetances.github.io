***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](fa2021_assignment9.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas

**Notice:** *In this assignment, all the plot should have title, caption, and axis labels. *

1. Use the dataset by of covid 19 by WHO at https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv. Find the three countries with the most numbers of deaths by Covid-19. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
df = read_csv('https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv')
```

Hint: 

-  Use `filter` to select the most current date 

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(Date_reported=='2022-10-13')
```

-  Pipe with `arrange(-Cumulative_deaths)` to rank the data by the number of cumulative deaths

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(Date_reported=='2022-10-13') %>%
  arrange(-Cumulative_deaths)
```

2. Use `transition_reveal` to make a plot revealing the number of deaths in the three countries with the most numbers of deaths
```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c('United States of America','Brazil','India')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=Cumulative_deaths,
            x=Date_reported,
            color=Country))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  transition_reveal(Date_reported)
```

3. Create the new variable (column) `death_per_cases` recording the number of deaths per cases (Hint: divide cumulative deaths by cumulative cases).  What are the three countries with the highest deaths per cases? 

```{r}
df <-  df %>% filter(Cumulative_cases>0) %>% mutate(death_per_cases = Cumulative_deaths/Cumulative_cases) 
```

```{r}
df %>% top_n(death_per_cases, n = 3) 
```

4.Use `transition_reveal` to make a plot revealing the number of deaths per cases of the US, Italy and Mexico. 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c('United States of America','Italy','Mexico')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=death_per_cases,
            x=Date_reported,
            color=Country))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  transition_reveal(Date_reported)
```

5. Import the following data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv
                      
Use `transition_reveal` to plot the total vaccinations per hundred by level of income. Hint: the levels of income are identified in the `location` variable. Put a short comment on the caption of the plot. 

```{r}
df3 <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv')
```
```{r}
df3 %>% filter(location %in% c('Low income', 'Lower middle income', 'Upper middle income')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = total_vaccinations_per_hundred, x = location))+geom_line()+transition_reveal(date)
```

As you can see from the visual plot, there is a definite correlation with vaccines taken and the income sector as the higher income sectors have many more total vaccines per hundred taken.
